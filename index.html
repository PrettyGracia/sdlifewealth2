        <h2>How is financial wealth different from human wealth?</h2>
        <p>Financial wealth refers to the accumulation of financial assets such as cash, investments, real estate, and other valuable possessions that can be converted into money. It provides economic security and the ability to achieve financial goals. Human wealth, on the other hand, encompasses the value of an individual's skills, knowledge, health, and relationships. It includes intangible assets such as education, experience, and social connections that contribute to an individual's overall well-being and ability to generate income.</p>

        <h2>What is an example of real wealth?</h2>
        <p>An example of real wealth is owning a piece of real estate, such as a home or commercial property. Real estate is considered real wealth because it is a tangible asset that can appreciate in value over time and generate income through rental payments. Other examples of real wealth include owning valuable commodities like gold or silver, and having a diversified investment portfolio that includes stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments.</p>
